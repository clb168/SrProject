This is a collection of my updates to myself to somewhat track things. we will see how often I add.

I am trying to build out a RAG retrival in this folder, mostly with Langchain. 
I plan on experimenting with things like ollama and llammaIndex aswell, i just dont know enough at the moment to explain how.

Ok so first I am going to follow the Ollama tutorial for Langchain with Ollama.
Ok so im running into an isssue with the port, I think its a firewall blocking. Im and going to take a step back and
try to work with langchain from the ground up?

I got the simple demo working. turns out im an idiot and just needed to reinstall ollama. -Casey
